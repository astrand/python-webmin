Since there is nothing like $main::no_acl_check in Python, you should
set variables in the webmin module instead. So, instead of doing:

$no_acl_check++;

you should do:

import webmin
webmin.no_acl_check = 1

Webmin uses a variable called "in". This is a keyword in Python, so it
is changed to "indata". 

Webmin does not allow a function and variable to have the same
name. Therefore, the text substitution function is called "textsub"
rather than "text". 

Non-public functions are prefixed with underscore. 

In Perl, referencing an associative array with an unknown key does not
produce any error but rather gives a empty result. This is not true in
Python. Therefore, it often makes sense to do
somedictionary.get("somekey", "") instead of
somedictionary["somekey"]. However, this method is not used for
translations via the "text" dictionary: We want to notice when a
translation is missing.
